The Point class represents a point (vector) structure in 2D. The class implements all the necessary methods, such as:

Addition/subtraction of vectors

Dot and cross product (with type overflow protection)

Rotate a vector by a given angle

And much more


The class greatly facilitates work on various geometric tasks and saves you time. I will be glad if it helps you!
